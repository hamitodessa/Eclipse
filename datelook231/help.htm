      1. Introduction
    </h2>
    <p>
      DateLook is a free electronic date book that features alarms, the ability
      to handle cyclic events, supports printing and is fully mouse-driven. It
      has an import/export-function (vCalendar V 1.0-format) and is able to
      synchronise its local database with a remote database in the net. The
      synchronisation can use FTP or any net file system. Therefore it is
      suitable for multi-user-operation. DateLook provides an unconventional
      graphical user interface. It is written in Java and requires a Java
      runtime environment 1.5.0 or later.

    <a name="How_to_use"></a> 
    <h2>
      2. How to use
    </h2>
    <p>
      The <b>Main</b>-window is split into the upper part with a calendar and
      the lower part, the "events display", to show your events as coloured
      rectangles. When the mouse is over a rectangle, then the summary of this
      event appears. The "events display" has a variable number of rows used to
      group the events as you like (e.g. row 1: family; row 2: work ...) and to
      prevent overlapping.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dragging with left-mouse-button or rotating the mouse-wheel shifts the
      visible space of time. Dragging with right-mouse-button in the calendar
      or rotating the mouse-wheel while holding the shift-key zooms the visible
      space of time. If you use the wheel, then the shift or zoom speed depends
      on where the mouse-pointer is: fast in the year-bar, medium in the
      month-bar or slow in the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      A click with the right-mouse-button on an empty place of the "events
      display" or pressing control-m opens a <b>pop-up-menu</b> with the options:
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Event Manager</b>, <b>Goto</b>, <b>Print</b>, <b>Predef Colours</b>,
      <b>Row Manager</b>, <b>Extended View</b>, <b>Show Row Labels</b>, <b>Save
      GUI-settings</b>, <b>Help</b>, <b>Revert &amp; Exit</b> and <b>Exit</b>:
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The <b>EventManager</b>-window gives a quick overview of all stored
        events and provides the possibilities to search for or to delete groups
        of events, to import/export events from/to a file in "vCalendar V
        1.0"-format or to synchronise the local database with a remote database
        in the net on a FTP- or any other file-server.
      </li>
      <li>
        The <b>GoTo</b>-window allows quick changes of the shown space of time.
      </li>
      <li>
        The <b>Print</b>-option allows printing the shown <b>Main</b>-window in
        the Extended View.
      </li>
      <li>
        The <b>Predef Colours</b>-option opens the window to edit predefined
        colours. For details see <a href="#Predefined_colours">chapter 2.5</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        The <b>Row Manager</b>-option opens the window to edit the row labels
        and to change the number of rows. Row labels can be used if you like to
        use one row for events of a special kind e.g. for meetings. Then the
        label "Meeting" can be attached to that row. For details see <a href=
        "#Row_manager">chapter 2.6</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the <b>Extended View</b>-mode the <b>Main</b>-window is enlarged and
        contains additionally in its lower part the "summaries display". The
        "summaries display" shows the summaries of all visible events.
      </li>
      <li>
        The <b>Show/Hide Row labels</b>-option switches the visibility of the
        row labels on or off.
      </li>
      <li>
        The <b>Save GUI-settings</b>-option stores the current position and
        size of the <b>Main</b>-window on screen, its zoom-state, the view mode
        (extended or simple), the visibility of the row labels and the number
        of rows for the next start of DateLook.
      </li>
      <li>
        The <b>Help</b>-option opens this User Manual.
      </li>
      <li>
        With <b>Revert &amp; Exit</b> DateLook can be left but it reverts to
        the old database at start-time. Here all changes made in the local
        database are lost. This is suitable e.g. if you accidentally deleted
        events. Changed remote databases are not affected. They remain changed.
      </li>
      <li>
        With <b>Exit</b> all changes remain stored and DateLook is left.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Remark that pressing the F1-key opens the <b>Help</b>-window from each
      other window. Furthermore many functions can be controlled by keyboard.
      For details see <a href="#Keyboard">chapter 2.11</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note for Mac OSX users: To emulate the right mouse button (unfortunately
      absent on Mac Computers) press the command-key additionally before
      pressing the only mouse button.

    <a name="Create_a_new_event"></a> 
    <h2>
      2.1 Create a new event
    </h2>
    <p>
      Press the left-mouse-button into the "events display" at the place where
      your event begins and in the row of your choice. Drag to right to the
      place where the event ends and release the mouse button. Automatically
      the <b>Editor</b>-window appears. If you like to create a whole-day-event
      (0 - 24:00 e.g. a birthday) press additionally the shift-key while
      dragging.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <b>Editor</b>-window shows different entries:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Begin</b> - time when the event begins,
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>End</b> - time when the event ends,
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Alarm</b> - time when an alarm is given,
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Cycle</b> - repetition cycle (e.g. "2 monthly" stands for every
        other month), the number of repetitions (including the first) and the
        day of last occurrence,
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Class</b> - "Public" or "Private" (see <a href=
        "#Synchronisation">chapter 2.9</a>).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      A right-mouse-click increases; a left-mouse-click decreases the value of
      an entry. For fast changes the mouse-wheel can be used too. Alarm can be
      set <b>On</b> or <b>Off</b>. But there are three rules that must be
      observed: Alarm (if On) must be equal or earlier than Begin, Begin must
      be equal or earlier than End and for cyclic events it is not allowed to
      overlap itself. If one of these rules is violated you can't save the
      event but the wrong entry is highlighted red.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remark that there is no plausibility check for entered Begin-, End- and
      Alarm-times and -dates. If you enter e.g. the 31st of February or 02.30
      at the day when the day-light-saving-time is switched, then the date and time
      is silently corrected to the 3rd of March or to 03.30 o'clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      DateLook handles cyclic events. For that you can choose in the
      Cycle-entry a multiplier (range 1 to 9) followed by:
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>daily, weekly, monthly</b> or <b>yearly.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      With the help of the multiplier cycles of e.g. 2 weeks or 3 months can be
      chosen. A cyclic event occurs first like a non-cyclic event according to
      its Alarm-, Begin- and End-time, but later on periodically with the given
      cycle. Of course the number of occurrences (including the first) can be
      chosen. The range is from 2 to 999. For your information the day of the
      last occurrence is shown right of that number.
    </p>
    <p>
      An alarm (if On) is given for each occurrence. Note that the
      <b>Editor</b>-window shows the Begin-, End- and Alarm-time always for the
      FIRST occurrence of this event. The <b>EventManager</b>-window shows
      cyclic events only once at its first occurrence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The summary of the event can be entered in the <b>text field</b> using
      the keyboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you want to store additional information attached to that event, press
      the <b>Description</b>-button. The <b>Description Editor</b>-window
      appears now. Here a longer description can be entered. As long as the
      <b>Description Editor</b>-window is open the <b>Editor</b>-window is
      locked. Changes in the description are saved only with the
      <b>save</b>-button in the <b>Editor</b>-window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pressing the <b>save</b>-button saves the new event and closes the
      <b>Editor</b>-window. Pressing the <b>cancel</b>-button discards the new
      event and closes the <b>Editor</b>-window.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="ColourChooser"></a> You can individually choose the colour of an
      event by pressing the <b>colour</b>-button. If done the
      <b>ColourChooser</b>-window appears. As long as the
      <b>ColourChooser</b>-window is open the <b>Editor</b>-window is locked.
      The <b>ColourChooser</b>-window displays eight rows for eight different
      colours. Each row consists of a <b>Label-</b>entry, three
      <b>colour-values</b> for red-, green- and blue-part of the colour (RGB,
      range 0 to 255) and the <b>select</b>-button to choose that colour for
      the current event. In the first row the current colour of the event
      appears. This colour can be changed by mouse-click on the
      <b>colour-values</b>. Left click increases; right click decreases the
      <b>colour-value</b>. Mouse wheel works too. In the following seven rows
      there are predefined colours and labels. They can not be changed here.
    </p>

    <a name="Edit_an_event"></a> 
    <h2>
      2.2 Edit or Print an event
    </h2>
    <p>
      A right-mouse-click on an event's rectangle or summary in the
      <b>Main</b>-window opens the <b>Editor</b>-window for that event. Another
      possibility is to open the <b>EventManager</b>-window as described above.
      Here a right-mouse-click on an unhighlighted event's row opens the
      <b>Editor</b>-window for that event. A right-mouse-click on a highlighted
      event opens <b>Editor</b>-windows for all highlighted events. Coming from
      the <b>EventManager</b>-window in the <b>Editor</b>-window an additional
      <b>go to</b>-button appears to make this event quickly visible on the
      <b>Main</b>-window.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the <b>Editor</b>-window you can modify all entries. Furthermore here
      a <b>delete</b>-button appears to delete this event completely. The
      <b>cancel</b>-button discards changes and closes the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pressing the <b>Description</b>-button the <b>Description
      Editor</b>-window appears to edit the event's detailed description.
      Changes in the description are saved with the <b>save</b>-button in the
      <b>Editor</b>-window.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <b>Print</b>-button opens a printer dialog to print this single event
      including its detailed description.
    </p>
    <p>
      In <b>Main</b>-window events can easily changed by drag-and-drop. With
      left-mouse-button events can be shifted to another date or row. Begin-,
      End- and Alarm-time are shifted by the same value. If you want to shift
      the event exactly by one day or you want to change the row only without
      changing of time, then press the shift-key additionally while dragging.
      After drop the <b>Editor</b>-window appears automatically. To save the
      changes press the <b>save</b>-button or to cancel the changes press the
      <b>cancel</b>-button.
    </p>
    <p>
      While dragging pressing the cntrl-key makes a copy of the event.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="#top">[top]</a>
    </p>
    <a name="Delete_events"></a> 
    <h2>
      2.3 Delete and undelete events
    </h2>
    <p>
      Open the <b>Editor</b>-window for the event you want to delete. This
      can be done by a right-mouse-click on the event's rectangle or its 
      summary in the <b>Main</b>-window. Then press the <b>delete</b>-button
      in the <b>Editor</b>-window.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you want to delete more than one event at once, then open the
      <b>EventManager</b>-window, select all events, you want to delete, with
      the left-mouse-button and press the <b>delete</b>-button in the upper
      part of the <b>EventManager</b>-window. The button text changes to
      "sure?". If you are sure press the button again within the next three
      seconds. Otherwise the button text returns to "delete" and you must start
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that the selection model is the same as for Windows(c). Use
      the cntrl-key to add/remove a single event to/from an existing selection;
      use the shift-key to select a whole area between an already selected
      event and the event you click on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remark that deleted events are still stored in DateLook's local database.
      But these events are not visible for the user. Storing of deleted 
      events is needed for synchronisation (see <a href="#Synchronisation">chapter 2.9</a>).
    </p>
    <p>
      Pressing the <b>undelete</b>-button in the <b>EventManager</b>-window 
      undeletes ALL events that were deleted since last purge (see <a href="#Purge">
      chapter 2.10</a>) of database. These events are now highlighted and (if disliked) 
      can be easily deleted again by pressing the <b>delete</b>-button. 
      All other not highlighted rows collapse to a small stripe.

    <h2>
      2.4 Alarm
    </h2>
    <p>
      If the Alarm-time of an event is reached or DateLook detects events with
      pending alarms (at program-start), then for each of these events an
      <b>Alarm</b>-window is opened accompanied by a beep. If the Alarm-time of
      an imported or newly created event is in the past, then no alarm is
      given.

    <a name="Predefined_colours"></a> 
    <h2>
      2.5 Predefined Colours
    </h2>
    <p>
      DateLook provides the possibility to predefine colours for specific
      topics of events such as "family" or "sports" or what ever you want. The
      advantage is that you have a better overview of the kind of events in the
      <b>Main</b>-window.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <b>PredefColourEditor</b>-window can be opened from
      <b>Main</b>-window by a right-mouse-click into the "events display" and
      choosing the <b>Predef Colours</b>-option.
    </p>
    <p>
      This <b>PredefColourEditor</b>-window displays seven rows for seven
      predefined colours. Each row consists of a <b>Label-</b>entry, three
      <b>colour-values</b> for red-, green- and blue-part of the colour (RGB,
      range 0 to 255) and the <b>colour</b>-field to show how the colour looks
      like. Labels can be modified by keypad. First click into the field you
      want to modify and then edit the label text. The colours can be changed
      by mouse-click on the <b>colour-values</b>. Left click increases; right
      click decreases the <b>colour-value</b>. Mouse wheel works too. The
      <b>save</b>-button saves the changes of the labels and colours and closes
      the window. The <b>cancel</b>-button closes the window too but without
      saving.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remark that the events don't contain any information about colour labels.
      They only contain the colour. This means if you change a predefined
      colour later, then all already stored events with that "old" label colour
      don't change its colour. Imported events have the colour chosen by its
      creator independent of his or your predefined colours and labels.

    <a name="Row_manager"></a> 
    <h2>
      2.6 Row Manager
    </h2>
    <p>
      To change the number of rows displayed in the <b>Main</b>-window and 
      to attach a text label to each rows use the <b>Row Manager</b>-window. 
      By using text labels for rows it is very easy to manage e.g. attendance and 
      resource availability information.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <b>Row Manager</b>-window can be opened from <b>Main</b>-window by a
      right-mouse-click into the "events display" and choosing the <b>Row
      Manager</b>-option.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <b>Row Manager</b>-window displays the <b>Visible rows</b>- field on
      the most upper side. The number can be changed by a mouse-click on the digit. 
      Left click increases; right click decreases the value. 
      The mouse-wheel can be used too. The range is between 5 and 20 rows.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <b>Row Manager</b>-window contains one <b>text</b>-field for each row to edit
      the label text. Independent of the current number of 
      displayed rows here all labels from row 1 to row 20 can be edited.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <b>save</b>-button saves the all modified row labels and
      the number of displayed rows (in the <b>Main</b>-window) and closes the
      <b>Row Manager</b>-window. The <b>cancel</b>-button closes the window too
      but without saving. Then all modifications are discarded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remark that if you create a new event in e.g. row number 7 and then the
      number of rows are decreased to a value lower than 7, then this event is
      displayed in the lowest row. But it remembers internally the original row
      number 7 until it is dragged to another place and saved again. For this
      reason it is not suitable to change the numbers of rows very often. Best
      is to determine the needed number of rows if you start using DateLook and
      then never change it.

    <p>
      While exporting events DateLook stores the row where an event is displayed
      (see <a href="#Export_and_Import">chapter 2.8</a> too.). If such an
      event is imported it is displayed in exact that row, independent of the
      row's label. But if the row number is greater than the number of
      currently displayed rows, then it is shown in the lowest row. For that
      reason if you use DateLook in a multi-user environment all DateLook
      instances should use the same number of displayed rows. If DateLook
      imports an event from other programs then this event is put to the most
      upper row.

    <h2>
      2.7 Search for events
    </h2>
    <p>
      First open the <b>EventManager</b>-window. Enter in the text field one or
      more search strings separated by blanks. A search string can consist of
      alphabetic characters, numbers and special signs except of quotation
      (<b>"</b>) or, if you like, of nothing (to quickly select all rows). If a
      search string should include blanks it must be encapsulated by quotation
      (<b>"</b>). Pressing the <b>search</b>-button starts searching. Searching
      is done within the Date-, Time-, Class-, Cycle- and Summary-column of the
      table, not in the descriptions of the events. (Remember that cyclic
      events occur only once in the table.) As result all rows containing ALL
      of the search strings are highlighted and the table scrolls to the first
      hit. All other rows collapse to a small stripe. A left-mouse-click into
      the table re-opens all rows.

    <h2>
      2.8 Export and Import events to/from file
    </h2>
    <p>
      DateLook can export selected (=highlighted) events to a file in "vCalendar V 1.0"-format
      or events can be imported from a file in "vCalendar V 1.0"-format. This
      is suitable if you use DateLook at different computers e.g. at home
      and in the office or if you want to exchange events with other programs
      that understand the "vCalendar V 1.0"-format.
    </p>
    <p>
      To export events open the <b>EventManager</b>-window. Select the events
      you want to export to a file with the left-mouse-button as described in
      the <a href="#Delete_events">chapter 2.3</a>. Then press the
      <b>export</b>-button. A file chooser appears. Select a directory here,
      enter any desired file name (file extension .vcs is recommended) and
      press the <b>export</b>-button of the file chooser. That's all. Remark
      that an already existing file will be overwritten without any warning.
      You can use the "search"-function to select events to export.
    </p>
    <p>
      To import events press the <b>import</b>-button in the
      <b>EventManager</b>-window. Select a valid file in "vCalendar V
      1.0"-format with the help of the appearing file chooser and press here
      the <b>import</b>-button. After successful import the new events are
      highlighted in the <b>EventManager</b>-window. All other rows collapse to
      a small stripe. A left-mouse-click into the table re-opens all rows. If
      you dislike the imported events, you can easily delete them all by
      pressing the <b>delete</b>-button as long as they are highlighted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The import feature follows the rule that each event with an unknown or
      without an Unique IDentifier (UID) is taken over into the own (local)
      database. Otherwise if there is an event with the same UID in the local
      database, then the LAST-MODIFIED-property is compared and the younger one
      is taken. If there is no LAST-MODIFIED-property in the event in file,
      then this event is not taken.
    </p>
    <p>
      All events which are deleted remain in the local database, but marked
      as deleted. During import, events with same UID of a deleted event are 
      not taken over into the local database, but only if the deletion took place later 
      then the last modification of the event to be imported. Otherwise
      the remote event will be imported.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remark that the exchange of events with other programs than DateLook can
      lead to the lost of some properties of an event. Because not all programs
      can handle all properties. Especially some programs don't support cyclic
      events. Please, turn the special attention towards the exchange of events
      between hosts in different time zones. E.g. an event starting at 08.00
      will start at 07.00 after transfer from a host in Berlin to another one
      in London, because this is exact the same time if globally seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      If DateLook imports events created on a computer using a different
      character set, then these events are displayed properly. But if such an event
      is modified and saved, then all characters only belonging to the current
      character set (used on own computer) and not belonging to origin
      character set are replaced by question marks.

    <a name="Synchronisation"></a> 
    <h2>
      2.9 Synchronisation
    </h2>
    <p>
      DateLook can synchronise its local database with a remote database. The
      remote database can be stored in a file on a FTP-server or any other mounted
      or local file system. This file is in "vCalendar V1.0"-format too. The
      synchronisation takes place in two steps. First step is the import of
      events from the remote database according to the same rules as described
      in <a href="#Export_and_Import">chapter 2.8</a> but including deleted events.
      Whereas the LAST-MODIFIED-property of a deleted event is set to the time of deletion.
      Imported deleted events remain marked as deleted. This means if there is
      a deleted event in the remote database with same UID as another in local database
      and the deletion took place later then the last modification of the local one
      then the event will be deleted from local database.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second step is to overwrite the remote database with the updated local 
      database (including deleted events too). But while the second step only events 
      of the <b>Class "Public"</b> are written to the remote
      database. This is suitable for multi-user-operation to protect your
      "private" events from propagation into the remote (common) database.
    </p>
    <p>
      To perform a synchronisation open the <b>EventManager</b>-window and
      press the <b>sync</b>-button. Now the <b>Synchroniser</b>-window appears.
      Here you have the choice between an FTP-server or two file-servers 1 or 2. To change
      click on this text field. If you choose FTP-server and the FTP-server
      needs authentication, please enter your user name ("UID") and your
      password ("PW"). Otherwise leave both entries empty. Remark that the
      password is stored unencrypted in a settings-file. In the entry "H/P" the
      host name and the path of the remote database (e.g.
      "ftp.blabla.de/datelook/database.vcs" or
      "h:\blabla.de\datelook\database.vcs") is required. The file name of that
      database is free. If it doesn't exist, it will be created during
      synchronisation. Note that the chosen file (remote database) will be
      overwritten with the updated local database independent of its old
      content.
    </p>
    <p>
      Press the <b>sync</b>-button in the <b>Synchroniser</b>-window to start
      the synchronisation. If finished the <b>Synchroniser</b>-window
      disappears and in the <b>EventManager</b>-window all updated and imported
      events are highlighted. The number of deleted events is displayed on the
      upper side. If an error occurred during synchronisation, then
      the <b>Synchroniser</b>-window remains and shows an error-message. To
      close the <b>Synchroniser</b>-window without synchronisation press the
      <b>close</b>-button.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remark that simultaneous synchronisation of different DateLook-users in
      multi-user-operation can NOT lead to a lost of data (provided that FTP-
      or file-server works well). But it can occur, that not all local
      databases are really synchronised. Because there is a race condition
      between to "Synchronisers". For that reason it is recommended to
      synchronise the databases again if you recognise some unexpected delay.
    </p>
    <p>
    <a name="Purge"></a> 
    <h2>
      2.10 Purge the database
    </h2>
    <p>
      DateLook stores deleted events in the local and remote database
      to prevent the (re)import of already deleted events from remote databases
      and to request the deletion of events in other instances of DateLook.
      But this fact leads to a continuously growing database while the number
      of "undeleted" events can remain constant. Therefore from time to time 
      it is suitable to purge the database of already deleted events. 
      To purge the database open the <b>EventManager</b>-window
      and press the <b>purge</b>-button. The button text changes to
      "sure?". If you are sure press the button again within the next three
      seconds. Otherwise the button text returns to "purge".
      Purge can be undone by exiting DateLook via "Revert & Exit" menu-item.

      2.12 Start DateLook from command line
    </h2>
    <p>
      You can start DateLook from command line:
      <br>
      <br>
       <b>java -jar [PATH/]datelook23.jar</b> for Linux or
      <br>
       <b>java -jar [DRIVE:][PATH\]datelook23.jar</b> for Windows or
      <br>
       <b>java -jar [PATH/]DateLook.app/Contents/Resources/Java/datelook23m.jar</b>
       for MacOSX.
      <br>
      <br>
       If you don't want to use the default local database file (described in
      <a href="#Files">chapter 3</a>), then you can specify any other database
      file as an optional start parameter. If not exists this file will be 
      created else it must be in "vCalendar V1.0"-format.
      <br>
      <br>
       e.g. java -jar [PATH/]datelook23.jar <b>-d [PATH/]other.vcs</b>
      <br>
      <br>
       In this case DateLook displays only events from this file and stores all
      modification to there. But don't try to start two or more instances of
      DateLook with one and the same database file. This will fail because of
      the first instance locks that database file by creating a lock file
      "*.vcs.locked" in the same directory. For that reason don't kill a
      running DateLook because then the used database will NOT be unlocked and
      then you must delete the lock file manually.
      <br>
      <br>
       If you want to store the settings on another place, than the user's
      default directory, then you can use the <b>-s</b> option followed by the
      path of the <b>.datelook</b>-directory (e.g. "/home/rene/othersettings"
      exclusive ".datelook"). If there is no <b>.datelook</b>-directory at the
      specified place, then it will be created with the default settings.
      <br>
      <br>
       e.g. java -jar [PATH/]datelook23.jar <b>-s [PATH_OF_SETTINGS]</b>
    </p>

    <h2>
      3. Files
    </h2>
    <p>
      Linux, Windows: DateLook itself comes as a single JAR-file
      <b>datelook23.jar</b>. "23" stands for the version number "2.3". This file
      can be copied to a place where ever you want. Best places are e.g.
      /usr/local/bin or C:/Programme/....
    </p>
    <p>
      Mac OS X: The application and all needed files are located in the Folder
      <b>DateLook.app</b> (including the jar-file <b>datelook23m.jar</b>).
      This folder is part of the download-file datelook23.dmg.gz. If
      datelook23.dmg.gz is mounted you can copy this folder where ever you
      like. But the Application-folder is recommended. Remark that the Finder
      hides the extension ".app". You only see "DateLook".
    </p>
    <p>
      For all OS: The setting files and the database are generated
      automatically and stored in the subdirectory <b>.datelook</b> of the
      user's default directory (if not modified by start parameters, see <a
      href="#Start_datelook">chapter 2.12</a>). These files are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>dates.vcs</b> - is an ASCII-file and stores the default local
        database (including already deleted events) in "vCalendar V1.0"-format.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>dates.vcs.bak</b> - is an ASCII-file and stores a backup of the
        state of the local database at the moment when DateLook was started. It
        only exists while DateLook is running.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>dates.vcs.lock</b> - is an empty file that indicated, that the local
        database is locked and can not be used by other program-instances of
        DateLook. It only exists while DateLook is running and using that
        database.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>guirc</b> - stores the GUI-settings..
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>rowrc</b> - stores the number of shown rows and the row labels.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>syncrc</b> - stores the synchronisation settings.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>colourrc</b> - stores the predefined colours and colour labels for
        the colour chooser.
      </li>
    </ul>
